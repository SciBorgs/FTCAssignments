# Project 0

This is pretty long, but only the first 3 sections are necessary prerequisites for future projects, so prioritise those. As always, there is no due date, so you can work on this on your own timeline. Just note that the sooner you complete projects, the sooner FRC teams have the option of taking you!

If you need help with any part of this, at least one FRC programming head should be at every meeting, so feel free to ask for help there. You can also contact us by email, at sigalm2@nycstudents.net, asap6@nycstudents.net, and alicel2789@nycstudents.net, andanqik@nycstudents.net (we'd prefer you cc all of us rather than sending to just one).

Note that starting next week, we will be using GitHub for all projects.

## Submission

You don't need to submit anything for parts [1](#1-setting-up-git), [2](#2-installing-wpilib), and [3](#3-organizing-your-computer), but we will assume that you have completed them for all future projects.

For part [4](#4-euler-problems), submit your code through these forms:

[problem 8 submission](https://forms.gle/LyqHTr19krnMAnM87)

[problem 9 submission](https://forms.gle/P8waxsBCAvAHCbgaA)

[problem 10 submission](https://forms.gle/iei2hu2msQpZoK2z6)

[problem 11 submission](https://forms.gle/ufkSyZziApBprFy19)

The submissions are for individual problems. We encourage you to take a stab at all of them, but feel free to do as many or as few as you can.

You will need to submit your code, either as a file attachment or as a replit link. You will also need to submit a picture of the Project Euler success page that will show if you input the correct answer.

Again, if you get stuck on anything, come to us during meetings or shoot us an email and we can help.

## 1: Setting up Git

### What is Git?

Imagine you wrote all your code in Google Drive. Why would that be a bad idea?

Instead, we use a version control system called Git.

### Setup
1. create a github account (if you haven't already)
2. follow [this guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) to install git on a personal computer
    - Important note: if you have linux, we recommend choosing the "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" option

### Learning how to use git
Follow [this tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) to learn about how to use git. Please complete the introductory sequence.

Note that it will assume you are familiar with certain concepts and vocabulary (i.e. directory), so make sure to look up any words you don't understand! Additionally, the commands it is teaching you would generally be typed into a command-line shell (terminal for MacOS or Linux; command shell, powershell, or git bash, or terminal for Windows).

Please go through [command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line) to learn more!

## 2: Installing WPILib

### What is WPILib?
WPILib is the library that we use to code FRC robots. After this installation, you will be able to complete more robotics specific future projects.

### Setup
Follow [this guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install the latest version of WPILib on a personal computer.

## 3: Organizing your computer
As part of this program, you will be writing a lot of code, and your life will be so much eaasier if you have that code nicely organized on your computer. If you haven't already, please make a code folder and/or a robotics folder in your home directory. (You could also put it in documents, but I wouldn't reccomend it). All code you write in the future, including the code for the next part of this homework (if you don't use Replit), should go in this new folder.

On that note, I know a lot of you guys are probably using mostly Replit at this point, but that will change very soon, so don't skip this step!

## 4: Euler Problems
Project Euler is a series of math/computational problems meant to be solved with code. It's a great resource, and we will on occasion assign these problems as a suplement to whatever robotics related work we give.

### Setup
1. go to [this page](https://projecteuler.net/register) to make an account
2. Save your username and password somewhere you won't lose it!!
3. log in

### Problems
All the euler problems can be found in the project euler [archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). You can solve them wherever you want with whatever language you want, and enter your result you get into project euler to check your solution.

As a general matter **PLEASE DON'T CHEAT**! If we find out, you will be disqualified from joining FRC, and even if we don't, it's a bad strategy. Remember that your in person work will be a big factor in admission to FRC teams, so if you cheat on your assignemnts, you won't show the understanding in person that you do from online submissions, and we will notice.

The problem set for this project is euler problems [8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8) to [11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11).

Have fun!
